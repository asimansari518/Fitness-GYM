                <p>1. Exercise is great for your brain. It's linked to less depression, better memory and quicker learning. Studies also suggest that exercise is, as of now, the best way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, a major fear for many Americans.Scientists don't know exactly why exercise changes the structure and function of the brain, but it's an area of active research. So far, they've found that exercise improves blood flow to the brain, feeding the growth of new blood vessels and even new brain cells, thanks to the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF triggers the growth of new neurons and helps repair and protect brain cells from degeneration. It may also help people focus, according to recent research.</p>
                <p>2. You might get happier. Countless studies show that many types of exercise, from walking to cycling, make people feel better and can even relieve symptoms of depression. Exercise triggers the release of chemicals in the brain—serotonin, norepinephrine, endorphins, dopamine—that dull pain, lighten mood and relieve stress. “For years we focused almost exclusively on the physical benefits of exercise and really have ignored the psychological and emotional benefits of being regularly active,” says Cedric Bryant, chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise.</p>
                <p>3. It might make you age slower. Exercise has been shown to lengthen lifespan by as much as five years. A small new study suggests that moderate-intensity exercise may slow down the aging of cells. As humans get older and their cells divide over and over again, their telomeres—the protective caps on the end of chromosomes—get shorter. To see how exercise affects telomeres, researchers took a muscle biopsy and blood samples from 10 healthy people before and after a 45-minute ride on a stationary bicycle. They found that exercise increased levels of a molecule that protects telomeres, ultimately slowing how quickly they shorten over time. Exercise, then, appears to slow aging at the cellular level.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-4 font-weight-bold">Shah Rukh Khan</h3>
                <img class="w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3" src="img/shah-rukh-khan.jpg" alt="Image">
                <p>While he was not exactly known for fitness, Shah Rukh Khan surprised us all with his six-pack in Om Shanti Om and eight-pack abs in Happy New Year. Since then, he has been hailed as one of the fittest celebrities in Bollywood and maintains his strong physique with a rigorous workout. The Bollywood actor has a set plan of workouts for five days of the week. He works on different body parts on different days. Shah Rukh Khan does 10-12 exercises every day. The exercises are divided into three supersets and a blowout for the chest, back, biceps, legs and abs. His protein-rich, low carb diet includes mostly skinless chicken, juice, steak, eggs and green salad. It'll make your skin look better. Aerobic exercise revs up blood flow to the skin, delivering oxygen and nutrients that improve skin health and even help wounds heal faster. “That's why when people have injuries, they should get moving as quickly as possible—not only to make sure the muscle doesn't atrophy, but to make sure there's good blood flow to the skin,” says Anthony Hackney, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Train long enough, and you'll add more blood vessels and tiny capillaries to the skin, too. The skin also serves as a release point for heat. (See “Why Does My Face Turn Red When I Exercise?” for more on that.) When you exercise, your muscles generate a lot of heat, which you have to give up to the environment so your body temperature doesn't get too high, Hackney says. The heat in the muscle transfers to the blood, which shuttles it to the skin; it can then escape into the atmosphere. Amazing things can happen in just a few minutes. Emerging research suggests that it doesn't take much movement to get the benefits. “We've been interested in the question of, How low can you go?” says Martin Gibala, an exercise physiologist at McMaster University in Ontario. He wanted to test how effective a 10-minute workout could be, compared to the typical 50-minute bout. The micro-workout he devised consists of three exhausting 20-second intervals of all-out, hard-as-you-can exercise, followed by brief recoveries. In a three-month study, he pitted the short workout against the standard one to see which was better. To his amazement, the workouts resulted in identical improvements in heart function and blood-sugar control, even though one workout was five times longer than the other. “If you're willing and able to push hard, you can get away with surprisingly little exercise,” Gibala says. (For more on the 1-minute workout read this.)</p>
                <h3 class="mb-4 font-weight-bold">Varun Dhawan</h3>
                <img class="w-50 float-right ml-4 mb-3" src="img/varun-dhawan.jpg" alt="Image">
                <p>One look at Varun Dhawan's Instagram profile immediately reveals his love and unmatched commitment to keeping fit and flaunting a picture perfect body. When it comes to workout plans, Varun likes to experiment with his routine. Along with bodyweight exercises and strength training, the actor swears by the benefits of Pilates. He also performs martial arts and yoga whenever he gets time. However, he suggests that it's best to follow one activity, be it going to the gym, swimming, or even cycling, for effective results while experimenting with other activities on the side for added flexibility and stamina. It can help you recover from a major illness. Even very vigorous exercise—like the interval workouts Gibala is studying—can, in fact, be appropriate for people with different chronic conditions, from Type 2 diabetes to heart failure. That's new thinking, because for decades, people with certain diseases were advised not to exercise. Now scientists know that far more people can and should exercise. A recent analysis of more than 300 clinical trials discovered that for people recovering from a stroke, exercise was even more effective at helping them rehabilitate. Dr. Robert Sallis, a family physician at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center in California, has prescribed exercise to his patients since the early 1990s in hopes of doling out less medication. “It really worked amazingly, particularly in my very sickest patients,” he says. “If I could get them to do it on a regular basis—even just walking, anything that got their heart rate up a bit—I would see dramatic improvements in their chronic disease, not to mention all of these other things like depression, anxiety, mood and energy levels.” Your fat cells will shrink. The body uses both carbohydrates and fats as energy sources. But after consistent aerobic exercise training, the body gets better at burning fat, which requires a lot of oxygen to convert it into energy. “One of the benefits of exercise training is that our cardiovascular system gets stronger and better at delivering oxygen, so we are able to metabolize more fat as an energy source,” Hackney says. As a result, your fat cells—which produce the substances responsible for chronic low-grade inflammation—shrink, and so does inflammation.</p>

                <img class="w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3" src="img/miranda-cohen.jpg" alt="Image">
                <p>Miranda Cohen Cutest Fitness Model In The World. Founder and CEO of Miranda Dream Fit, Miranda Cohen found her life purpose in coaching her clients, fervent in her desire to free them of the same self-doubt and disbelief Miranda once fought so hard to rectify in herself. Time and again, she proves that with dedication and discipline, achieving your fitness goals is possible when you have the proper resources, and a support system devoted to your success. Miranda will never give up; she does not believe in the language of “I can't,” and never will. I remember I used to be a little girl with hopes and dreams and at 16, I thought by age 24, I would have it all figured out. A husband, kids, a beautiful home, and a successful career. I'm now 26 and and have about a 1/4 of what I expected of my life. I can honestly say.. I'm genuinely happy. Life never goes as you plan it and we may have to take a few Michigan U turns to get back on track and that's okay :) I will definitely miss our U turns, but I'm sure Florida's clean, smooth roads will make up for it lol. Anyways, I'm happy, healthy, and on the best path I could ever be on. I am more than grateful and can't wait to see where this beautiful life takes me. A natural fighter, Miranda has endured challenges from the very beginning of her life; born with a hole in her heart, a condition known as Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), she was encouraged by her mother to live a healthy lifestyle to combat her medical circumstances--the possibility of open heart surgery always looming over her future. Despite the limitations of her condition, Miranda persevered, not to be defined by what she couldn't do, but instead recognized for all her potential. On a summer break from college, Miranda took a job working with her mother. As they spent more time together, Miranda's mother saw a competitive edge in her daughter that prompted her to say, “you better start your own business one day--you'll never be able to work for anyone else.” She was right, and Miranda knew it then, too. The pieces finally fell together. When she returned to college that next semester, she saw the potential her training and passion brought forth, and with the guidance and support of her friend and fellow mentor, Lucas, Miranda Dream Fit was born. Miranda received her credentials as a Personal Trainer through the International Sports Sciences Association in 2017. This certification culminates her diverse knowledge in both nutrition and training modalities, which enable her to effectively coach her clients, helping break through both the mental and physical barriers that so often stop individuals in completing their fitness journey. Miranda understands what the individual needs, and can create a workout plan that suits your lifestyle and needs.</p>
